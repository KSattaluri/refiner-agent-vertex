    ## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES
    - Tailor the answer specifically to the role and industry provided
    - If resume or job description information is provided, incorporate relevant details naturally
    - Focus on experiences that showcase skills applicable to the role
    - Be specific and use concrete examples
    - Maintain a professional tone throughout
    - Aim for a comprehensive yet concise answer for each part of the STAR response (overall 350-500 words for the entire answer).
    
    ## OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
    You MUST output the STAR answer as a single, valid JSON object.
    The JSON object should have the following keys, with string values for each:
    - "situation": The description of the situation or context.
    - "task": The explanation of the specific task, responsibility, or challenge.
    - "action": The detailed description of the specific actions taken.
    - "result": The description of the outcomes, accomplishments, or lessons learned.

    Do not include any explanations, headers, or additional commentary outside of this JSON object.
    Ensure the content for each key is personal ("I did..." not "One should...").

    Example JSON output (ensure your output is a single line JSON string or a properly formatted multi-line JSON that can be parsed):
    ```json
    {
      "situation": "During my final year project, our team was tasked with developing a mobile application for local community engagement within a tight deadline of three months.",
      "task": "My primary responsibility was to design and implement the user authentication module and the real-time chat feature, ensuring security and seamless user experience.",
      "action": "I started by researching best practices for secure authentication, chose Firebase Authentication for its robustness, and implemented OAuth 2.0. For the chat feature, I utilized Firebase Realtime Database, designed the data schema for messages, and developed the UI components for sending and receiving messages. I conducted regular code reviews with a teammate and performed iterative testing.",
      "result": "The authentication module was delivered on time and passed all security tests. The chat feature was highly praised for its responsiveness and ease of use, contributing to a 15% higher engagement rate in user testing than initially projected. The overall project was completed successfully and received an A grade."
